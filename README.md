# Bacteria-Diversity

## Overview
The dataset displayed here characterizes the bacterial species that colonize different individual's bellybuttons.  Microbiology biological researcher Roza hypothesizes there is a species of bacteria in the bellybutton which produces compounds that will produce the perfect meaty flavor for imitation beef.  To start testing this hypothesis, Roza swabbed the bellybuttons of participants and cultured them to quantify which species inhabit different participants and in what abundance these species were found.  If a species that produces a meaty flavor is later discovered, this dashboard will allow participants in the study to look up their participant ID to discover what species colonize their bellybuttons and whether their microflora could be sold to produce imitation beef.
